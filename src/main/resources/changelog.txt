1.1.0
    - (WIP) Added in dimensional configs.
1.0.2
    - The break speed of silverfish blocks is now modified to match that of the blocks they are imitating.
      - Can be turned off or set to instant-break.
1.0.1
    - Added a couple block name override options to better hide silverfish blocks and trapped chests from players using block tooltips. (Trapped chests not renamed by default.)
1.0
    - Official release!
    - Added brutal spawners, swarm spawners, fire traps, spawner traps, water veins, and sand veins.
    - Silverfish nests now have a change to be "aggressive" (spawns strong, poisoned silverfish).
    - Spawner veins are now disabled by default, spawner traps have officially replaced them.
    - Chests generated by this mod now use unique loot lists (use Custom Chest Loot to modify them).
    - Vein features' and most spawners' stats are now highly configurable (vein size, spawn speed, etc.).
    - All spawners have had their default max spawn delays lowered.
    - Bosses now have health regeneration (configurable) and can no longer spawn with invisibility.
    - Towers are now much more damaging (and configurable). Their detection range has also been shortened slightly.
    - Traps now try to hide a little bit better.
      - Usually have a stone pressure plate or carpet on top.
      - No longer generate on edges (their sides won't be exposed).
    - TNT spawners are now better about blowing themselves up, and slightly less destructive.
    - Potion traps are now more potent (and configurable).
    - Dungeons may now generate with brutal or swarm spawners.
    - Tweaked almost all defaults.
    - Probably some other stuff. Watch your back!

    - Improved performance!
    - Dungeons are now deadlier.
    - Added potion traps, chests, and bosses.
    - Towers now shoot arrows slightly faster at three different angles (up/middle/down).

      - I'd suggest deleting your old config.
